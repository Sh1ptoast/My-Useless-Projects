README: IMPORTANT
This is a satirical project meant to make fun of the constant culture war
posts on social media sites like Twitter (currently known as X) and Facebook,
this in NO WAY is representative of the views of its creator, and is purely
meant for satirical purposes. The creator (me) is openly against the content
slop posted on those sites, as it simply drives further divides between us.
